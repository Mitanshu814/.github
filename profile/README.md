BlackRock is passionate about open source software and aims to be a leader in financial technology.
One of our significant contributions to open source is [argo-events](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events), an
event-driven workflow automation framework for kubernetes. As part of the broader [argo](https://github.com/argoproj) 
project, argo-events was accepted to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in March 2020 and 
[graduated](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/12/06/the-cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-argo-has-graduated/) 
in December 2022. 

In addition, BlackRock has supported our employees in contributing to open source projects including:
* [kafka-security](https://github.com/kafka-security/oauth)
* [argo-cd](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd)
* [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)

We are actively working on launching our open source site, but in the meantime learn more about us (and our open
roles) at [our career site](https://careers.blackrock.com/life-at-blackrock-2/technology/)!
