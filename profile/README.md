![BlackRock Open Source](https://github.com/blackrock/.github-private/blob/main/images/blk-p.png) 

BlackRock is passionate about open source software and aims to be a leader in financial technology.
One of our significant contributions to open source is [argo-events](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events), an
event-driven workflow automation framework for kubernetes. As part of the broader [argo](https://github.com/argoproj) 
project, argo-events was accepted to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in March 2020 and 
[graduated](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/12/06/the-cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-argo-has-graduated/) 
in December 2022. 

In addition, BlackRock has supported open source by enabling our employees in authoring and contributing to open source projects including:
